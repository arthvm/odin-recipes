    <img src="" alt="">
    <h2>An <em>almost</em> authentic recipe to a <strong><em>very cheesy</em></strong> bread</h2>
        <p>The brazilian cheese bread is loved by every brazilian, or anyone who tries it.</p>
        <p>Altought the result from this recipe tastes <strong>identical</strong> to the original, one of the ingredients is used as a substitution for two of the original ingredients. That's because those are extremely hard to find in the US</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups tapioca flour (This is the substitution ingredient)</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons oil</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups grated parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded Mozarella cheese</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400<sup>0</sup>F;</li>
            <li>Boil the milk, water, oil and salt over medium high heat;</li>
            <li>Add the tapioca flour to a bowl, pour the milk mixture over when it boils. <strong>Mix it well</strong>. It should be white and sticky;</li>
            <li>Add the eggs, <em>one at a time</em>, and mix it well;</li>
            <li>Add the cheese, a little bit at a time, and incorporate well;</li>
            <li>Make small balls with the dough and place them in a baking sheet covered with parchment paper;</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>An easy way to shape the balls is by wetting your hands with cold water and, with a spoon, scooping some of the dough to shape it.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Bake until they are golden and puffed. It should take about 20-30 minutes;</li>
