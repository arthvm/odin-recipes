        <h2>The <em>perfect</em> pair for the Brazilian Cheese Breads</h2>
        <p>An authentic brazilian favorite.</p>
        <p>This <em>creamy and mild</em> recipe not only works for spreading, but can also be used as a great ingredient for a lot of other recipes.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>4 cups whole milk</li>
                    <ul>
                     <li>You might need about 2-4 extra tablespoons to use during the blending process.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>2 tablespoons of fresh lime juice</li>
                <li>1 1/2 tablespoons of butter</li>
                <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Boil the milk over medium heat;</li>
                <li>As soon as it comes to a boil, turn off the heat and stir the Lemon Juice. Set aside in order to curdle and cool down;</li>
                <li>Strain the mix through a fine-mesh sieve and press it down to release all the liquid;</li>
                <li>Blend the curdles with butter, salt, and the extra tablespoons of the extra milk. Blend until it has a creamy and spreadable texture;</li>
                <li>The brazilian cream cheese <strong><em>should not be solid</em></strong> as the American one. Add more tablespoons of milk if necessary;</li>
                <li><strong><em>Serve it chill!</em></strong> (About 3 hours in the fridge)</li>
